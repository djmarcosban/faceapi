# Spooky Masks, Facial Recognition, and Machine Learning

This demo made by [Gant Laborde](https://github.com/GantMan) and [Jason Lengstorf](https://github.com/jlengstorf) shows off how to use [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) to place spooky masks on photos using facial recognition and math!

This was created live as part of [_Learn With Jason_](https://learnwithjason.dev).
